# Week | 6 Wireless Networks
## Task 1. View Wi-Fi Details  
**List of APs that my device can show:**  
Command use: Scan-WifiAPs
It shows all the wifi list within range of my device.

**Details of connected wifi**  
Wi-Fi details of own device  
Command use: Show-WifiState and Show-WifiInterface

## Task 2. Use Wi-Fi Access Point  
Some important settings that should be consider when designing a Wi-Fi network are discussed below are:
1. **Number of users**  
While setting select limit number of users to make sure stable bandwidth to each device.

3. **Encryption**  
WPA2 has become the industry standard. If we access our router settings you’ll likely see 4 options: Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA), version 2 (WPA2), and version 3 (WPA3). As the oldest, WEP encryption is somewhat out of date. WPA2 is the industry standard. WPA3 covers up some security gaps in WPA2.

4. **Change the Default WiFi Password**  
Some Wi-Fi passwords are defaults that are way too easily found out. If we leave our router with the default password it’s more likely someone can find the password and get onto our network.

5. **Enable Automatic Firmware Updates**  
Enable automatic updates on your router’s firmware. If not, we might miss valuable security patches and other protective updates. If we can not set this to automatically update, we should check for updates monthly. When you do update, be sure double-check all the settings each and every time when installing a firmware update. They may default to changing for less aware users but those changes can up risk factor.

6. **Disable WPS**  
WPS stands for Wi-Fi Protected set-up. It’s essentially administrative access for your router. Someone simply needs to look at some settings on your router. With a snapshot of the numbers on your router, they have a free pass to your wi-fi network. This essentially lets them bypass any password you set up and get right onto your network. If possible, avoid routers that support WPS as they can be a beacon to enterprising hackers.

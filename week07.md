## Task 2. Create an Azure Resource    
After logging into Microsoft Learn on Demand,I first created a virtual machine. By creating virtual machine, I can easily run the applications at virtual environment in order to test various applications and processes without the need of actual hardware components. There are diffferent available sizes for the virtual machine among which I selected B1ls for the testing purpose. On checking the created resource group, I noticed that additional Public IP address, Network security group and virtual resources were created.

## Task 7. Compare Cloud vs On-premise Costs  
Consumer Desktop PC:
Specifications:

    CPU: Intel Core i5 10th generation
    RAM: 8 GB
    Storage: 512 GB SSD
    Graphics: Integrated graphics
    Operating System: Windows

Cost:
The cost of a consumer desktop PC with similar specifications can range from $500 to $800 upfront, depending on the brand and additional features.
Running Costs:
Running costs for a consumer desktop PC typically include electricity consumption and occasional maintenance or upgrades. The electricity cost can vary based on usage patterns and energy rates. Maintenance costs may involve occasional hardware upgrades or replacements.
Server:
Specifications:

    CPU: Intel Xeon E3-1220 v6
    RAM: 8 GB ECC DDR4
    Storage: 500 GB SATA HDD
    Networking: Gigabit Ethernet
    Operating System: Linux or Windows Server

Cost:
A server with similar specifications may cost around $800 to $1,200 upfront, depending on the brand, configuration, and additional features.
Running Costs:
Running costs for servers include electricity consumption, cooling, and periodic maintenance. Additionally, server software licenses and support contracts may incur additional expenses.
Cloud Virtual Machine (e.g., Azure VM):
Specifications:

    CPU: Intel Xeon E5-2673 v4
    RAM: 8 GB
    Storage: 512 GB SSD
    Networking: High-speed network connectivity
    Operating System: Windows or Linux

Cost:
The cost of a cloud virtual machine with similar specifications can vary based on the cloud provider, region, and pricing model. For example, an Azure VM with the given specifications may cost around $80 to $120 per month, depending on the specific VM series and region.
Running Costs:
Running costs for cloud virtual machines include the cost of compute resources, storage usage, and data transfer. Costs can vary based on usage patterns, data transfer volumes, and additional services utilized.
Trade-offs and Considerations:

    Upfront Cost: Consumer desktop PCs have a relatively lower upfront cost compared to servers or cloud VMs, as they do not require additional infrastructure.
    Scalability: Servers and cloud VMs offer better scalability options, allowing you to easily add resources as your needs grow. Consumer desktop PCs are typically limited in terms of scalability.
    Maintenance and Support: Servers and cloud VMs often come with managed infrastructure, providing regular maintenance, updates, and technical support. Consumer desktop PCs require self-maintenance and support.
    Accessibility and Location: Consumer desktop PCs are accessible locally, while servers and cloud VMs can be accessed remotely from anywhere with an internet connection.
    Ownership and Control: Consumer desktop PCs provide complete ownership and control over hardware and software, while servers and cloud VMs rely on service providers' infrastructure.

Choosing the appropriate option depends on factors such as budget, scalability needs, maintenance capabilities, data security requirements, and accessibility preferences. It's essential to consider long-term costs, growth potential, and the specific use case to make an informed decision.

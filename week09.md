# Week | 9 Cyber Security Management  
## Task 1. Select Security Objectives    
Considering our Project, four (4) different sub-categories of objectives from the NIST Cyber Security
Framework are selected where two (2) each from Protect and Detect functions, and both are from different
categories. That is:
1. **Function**: Protect;  
   **Category**: Identity Management, Authentication and Access Control (PR.AC);   
   **Sub-category**: Identities and credentials are issued, managed, verified, revoked, and audited for authorized devices, users    and processes.  
   **Importance**: It emphasises  the importance of identity and access management practices. Organisations may impose strict access restrictions, lower the risk of unauthorised access, increase user accountability, support compliance initiatives, and boost overall cybersecurity posture by assuring the correctness, integrity, and accountability of identities and credentials.
2. **Function**: Protect;  
   **Category**: Maintenance (PR.MA);  
   **Sub-categor**y:  Maintenance and repair of organizational assets are performed and logged, with approved and controlled        tools.  
   **Importance**: It highlights the significance of consistent upkeep, fixes, and accurate records of organisational assets. Organisations can improve asset performance, address vulnerabilities, satisfy compliance requirements, and guarantee the overall security and dependability of their infrastructure by adhering to best practises in maintenance, using authorised tools, following change management procedures, and maintaining accurate records.
   
3. **Function**: Detect;  
   **Category**: Anomalies and Events (DE.AE);  
   **Sub-category**: A baseline of network operations and expected data flows for users and systems is established and managed.  
   **Importance**: In order to detect abnormalities, make incident response and investigation easier, support risk management            initiatives, and improve network performance, it is crucial to build and monitor a baseline of network operations and            expected data flows. By creating this baseline, organisations can improve their capacity for risk mitigation, the                detection and response of security incidents, and the maintenance of a safe and dependable network infrastructure.
4. **Function**: Detect;  
   **Category**: Security Continuous Monitoring (DE.CM):;  
   **Sub-category**: The network is monitored to detect potential cybersecurity events.  
   **Importance**:  It draws attention to the value of proactive network monitoring for early threat identification, prompt incident response, insider threat detection, proactive risk management, regulatory compliance, and threat intelligence integration. Organisations may improve their overall cybersecurity posture and successfully defend their systems, data, and users from cyber threats by continuously monitoring the network.


## Task 2. Create Asset Inventory  
Hardware assets:-
| Asset Name       | 	Important Protections          |
| -----------------| --------------------------------|
| Switch           | Availability, Access Control    |
| Router           | Availability, Network Security  |  
| cameras          | Security                        |  

Data Assets:
| Asset Name       | 	Important Protections          |
| -----------------| --------------------------------|
|   Data           | Confidentiality, Availability   |
|   Video          | Confidentiality, Security       |  

## Task 3. Information Flow Check
